## HTTP Server base TCP
# Project Overview
This project implements a simplified HTTP server in Python, capable of handling GET requests for static content such as HTML files, images, and redirects. Additionally, a client program is included to test the serverâ€™s functionalities, including persistent connections and automatic reconnections. The project showcases fundamental networking principles, such as socket communication, request interpretation, and response construction in a web environment.

# Client
The client is designed to send HTTP GET requests to the server and supports persistent connections, allowing multiple requests to be sent over a single connection. It also includes mechanisms to detect and recover from connection failures.

# Key Features:

- Sends HTTP GET requests to a given server address and port.
- Supports Connection: keep-alive to maintain persistent connections.
- Detects connection drops and automatically reconnects, resending the last 
  request when needed.

# Server
The server listens for incoming HTTP requests and serves files from a specified directory. It also manages errors like missing files and redirections.

# Key Features:

- Operates on a designated TCP port.
- Serves static content from a predefined directory.
- Handles HTTP GET requests efficiently.
- Returns proper HTTP status codes:
  1) 200 OK for successful requests.
  2) 404 Not Found if a requested file is missing.
  3) 301 Moved Permanently for redirected resources.
- Logs HTTP request and response headers for debugging.
